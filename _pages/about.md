About Me
========

I am a 1st year EECS graduate student at MIT working with Marija Ilic. I
graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley in 2020 and
previously worked as a software engineer with Axiom Cloud and as a research
intern with the REopt group at NREL. My research interests include
decarbonization of the electric grid, optimization under uncertainty, and
distributed energy resource participation in electricity markets. In my free
time, I play mediocre guitar and read books about labor history.

More content coming (eventually...)
